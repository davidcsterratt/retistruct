\title{The deformation energy gradient function}
\usage{
Fcart(P, C, L, Tr, A, R, alpha = 1, x0, nu = 1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{N-by-3 matrix of point coordinates}

\item{C}{The connectivity matrix}

\item{L}{Length of each edge in the flattened outline}

\item{Tr}{Triangulation in the flattened outline}

\item{A}{Area of each triangle in the flattened outline}

\item{R}{Radius of sphere}

\item{alpha}{Area penalty scaling coefficient}

\item{x0}{Area penalty cut-off coefficient}

\item{nu}{Power to which to raise area}

\item{verbose}{How much information to report}
}
\value{
A vector representing the derivative of the energy of this
particular configuration with respect to the parameter vector
}
\description{
The function that computes the gradient of the  energy (or error)
of the deformation of the mesh from the flat outline to the
sphere. This depends on the locations of the points given in
spherical coordinates. The function is designed to take these as a
vector that is received from the \code{optim} function.
